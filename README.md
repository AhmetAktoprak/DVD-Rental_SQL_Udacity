### DVD Rental Database
Project Overview
This project uses SQL queries to analyze a database with data from a DVD rental company. The goal was to complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question, running appropriate SQL queries to answer your questions, and finishing by sharing your findings.

### Files necessary:
To run successfully your own data analysis you need the following files available in this repository:

DVD Rental ER Diagram: you need this diagram to check the relationships of entity sets stored in the database.
DVD Rental Database: the public database provided by PostgreSQL Tutorial website.
Tech used:
You need to install PostgreSQL on your local machine to successfully run the queries. A detailed tutorial on how to do it can be found here: PostgreSQL Tutorial.

### Results
Four queries were created to answer the following questions:
(First 3 questions in #Workspace1 and first question of #Workspace2 has been answered)

What is the most rented family friendly movies by category?
Compare the rental duration of movies by each period. What is the most movies rental duration? 
Which film category has highest rental duration in 1. quartile and which one has least rental duration in the 3. quartile?
Compare two stores rental order by every month and which month has the highest rental count for store 1 and store 2?
This pdf file shows the results I got after running those queries. The file with my own SQL queries is here.
